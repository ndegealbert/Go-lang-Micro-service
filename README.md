# Microservices Architecture with Go

## Overview

For a long time, web applications were primarily developed as monolithic applications, handling everything from user authentication to email notifications. While this approach remains popular, many larger-scale applications are shifting towards a microservices architecture. This architectural style structures an application as a loosely coupled collection of smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

## Features of Microservices

- **Maintainability and Testability:** Each microservice is small and focused, making it easier to maintain and test.
- **Loose Coupling:** Microservices are loosely coupled, reducing dependencies between them.
- **Independent Deployment:** Each service can be deployed independently, allowing for easier updates and scaling.
- **Business-Centric Organization:** Microservices are organized around specific business capabilities.
- **Small Team Ownership:** Each microservice can be owned by a small team, fostering accountability and ownership.

## Project Description

In this project, we will develop a series of self-contained microservices that communicate with each other and a simple front-end application. The services we will build include:

- **Front End Service:** Displays web pages.
- **Authentication Service:** Handles user authentication with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Logging Service:** Manages logs using a MongoDB database.
- **Listener Service:** Receives messages from RabbitMQ and acts upon them.
- **Broker Service:** An optional entry point into the microservice cluster.
- **Mail Service:** Converts JSON payloads into formatted emails and sends them out.

All services will be implemented in Go (Golang), a language particularly well-suited for building distributed web applications.

## Deployment

We will also cover deployment strategies for our distributed application using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, enabling us to scale services up and down as needed while ensuring minimal downtime during updates.
